    <h1>Hobbies</h1>  
    <p>My hobby is playing chess, for me there cannot be a better pursuit than playing chess in my spare time. It not only keeps me busy but also gives entertainment, provides a welcome change and creative satisfaction. However, it is never an obsession with me. It best suits my aptitude and liking.</p> 
    <p>It is an ageless game and its hold over the human imagination and mind. It helps in developing decision-making skills and abilities. A chess­ player’s strength lies in clear, rational thinking, right approach, logic, knowledge and ability not to commit a mistake. His power of vision, vigilance, intuition and imagination are what make him stronger than others.</p>

    <p>A game of chess means leisure time spent creatively and purposefully. It activates the central nervous system and develops positive emotional reaction. It is good training for those engaged in challenging tasks and intellectual pursuits. A player of chess is required to make a decisive move in a very complex situation and that too under pressure of time and that is what is required from people in many challenging professions.</p>
    <p>Chess players have been found to possess a higher spatial ability than others of comparable intelligence levels. They also possess greater physical endurance, together with tolerance of frustration. A game of chess is a manifestation of both the will to win and create beauty, with the player aiming to surmount all complexity, rigors and barriers to realise his plan and ideas. It appeals to me most because it involves, at every move, at each stage, intensiveness, enterprise, resourcefulness, self-control, determination, vision and the quick execution of the plan.</p>

    <p class="lastpara">It is an epic game, with the chessboard being like a battlefield and the two sets of pieces the two contending armies, and the two rival players think in terms of attack, defence, capture, threats, manoeuvres, ambushes and tactics. The game is full of such activities which suggest a real and live combat.</p>
